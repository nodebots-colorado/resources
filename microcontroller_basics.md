# Microcontroller Basics

## Microcontrollers

A microcontroller is simply a small processer with a single chip that takes some input and produces some output. As electronic hardware has become more affordable, they have become popular for prototyping new hardware.

## Arduino
Arduino is a mircocontroller designed to have a very low barrier of entry, meaning you can build quite a bit after you learn a few basics about how the board works.

The Arduino philosophy is about prototyping and tinkering to see if something actually works instead of spending time thinking about if it would work in theory. The bits of hardware are designed to be easily reusable and quickly altered. The goal is to engage in experimentation.


## The Board

- digital input/output
- PWM
- Analog input/output
- Power and ground
